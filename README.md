In this particular Notebook we will be understanding the difference between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. 
By understanding what I mean is:-
- Doing a quick Exploratory Data Analysis
- R-squared value of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression.

For performing EDA I have went ahead with Pandas Profile Report. This is a very useful package by pandas for a quick EDA.

***Please do feel free to make the necessary changes and also do give suggestions on how I can improve.***
